Reticulate is an important package to load while coding in Rstudio. This package allows for R to communicate with the Python system.Libraries are done in the R chunk.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

In python, make sure to import pandas and altair. Nicknames can help ut down on the time it takes to incorporate them into your code.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

from vega_datasets import data
cars = data.cars()

alt.Chart(cars).mark_bar(size=50).encode(
    x='Year',
    y = 'count()',
    color='Origin',
).interactive()
```
After importing pd and alt, you can import data from packages or upload your own data. After importing the data, make sure to turn it into a dataframe. To make a stacked bar graph, your data must have at least three columns (one categorical and two quantitative). If not, the count() function can count the number of times a name appears in a dataset.
